# UK_Accident_Analysis

With road traffic accidents causing 1.35million deaths in 2016, it is the number 8 global 
cause of death across all age groups, and is expected to be number 7 by 2030.(WHO, 
2022) 

The UK accident data for 2019 (UK Department For Transport, 2022) was analyzed in 
this project, to predict when and where road accidents are likely to occur. A model will 
also be developed to predict the severity of casualties involved in an accident. This is to 
help improve safety for all road users. The results from this model will be compared with 
an existing government model.
